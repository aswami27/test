Generative AI Chat bot:

How generative AI chatbots work
Large Language Models (LLMs): At their core, these chatbots are driven by LLMs. These are powerful neural networks trained on massive datasets to learn language patterns, grammar, and contextual relationships. Examples include models developed by organizations like Google (PaLM) and Anthropic (Claude).
Natural Language Processing (NLP): They use NLP techniques to interpret user input, identifying the intent and meaning behind the words.
Machine and Deep Learning: Machine learning enables the chatbot to improve its responses over time by learning from past interactions. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses multiple layers of algorithms to process information with increasing sophistication.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Some chatbots use RAG to go beyond their core training data. When a user asks a question, the chatbot can search an external knowledge base (like internal documents or public information) to find the most relevant information before generating a response.
